The term parking management system typically refers to the customized hardware-intensive
systems installed in buildings and malls. The project aims to build a cross-platform smart
parking system that can solve parking problems by reducing the time for drivers by searching
for vacant positions in car parking lots and also providing efficient parking space utilization.
Various reports have shown that the smart parking system reduces traffic problems and
increases business growth and economic development within that locality. However, there
are many places where such expensive solutions cannot be installed due to various reasons,
like cost and setup requirements. This project focuses on developing a parking management
system based on object detection to detect vacant parking slots in our college premises
where automated systems are not installed. Camera images of the parking area are put
through an object detection algorithm that detects virtual slots in the area and extracts
residency information to guide the potential drivers about the availability and position of
empty spaces. A smart parking system that involves a camera connected to an application
using cloud computing makes use of a less complex Machine Learning model to detect empty
positions. We train and cross-validate our model using the real-time customized dataset and
YOLOv5 algorithm. In order to display the reserved spaces based on the data fetched from
the model IoT will be used. The project for the backend will be using Cloud Services
